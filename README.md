## Project Description

The project task is to make a simplified version of an existing web application using backend technologies learned in Phase 2 of the course: i.e. [Express.js], [PostgreSQL], [knex.js], etc.

Our group chose to create an application like that of Tinder's.

[express.js]:https://expressjs.com/
[PostgreSQL]:https://www.postgresql.org/
[knex.js]:https://knexjs.org/
